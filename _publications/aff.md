title: "Computational Cognitive Architecture with Awareness of Real-world Contexts for Affordance-based Task Planning"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/aff
excerpt: 'We develop a social acceptable agent designed to function as an assistant to humans in home settings. A knowledge graph is employed to model people's common sense understanding of affordance, with additional designs integrated to incorporate real-world context into consideration. The agent's strengths lie in its foundation on a computational cognitive architecture and its high level of transparency.'
